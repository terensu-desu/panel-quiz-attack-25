# Panel Quiz Attack 25 Game
Built using pure Javascript and MaterializeCSS (v1 Aplha 3), this is a simple game based on the popular Japanese game show of the same name. One difference is that I have made it a 6 team game as that is how I needed it when I made it.

At the moment, I haven't set it up to automatically flip squares that have been surrounded, nor added anything special. However, it does have an erase tool that will allow you to flip a square back to neutral if you make a mistake. 

The original game show's gameplay, from the wikipedia entry:

# Original Gameplay
Four contestants, each designated by a different color (red, green, white, and blue), compete. The game is played on a grid of twenty-five numbered boxes in a manner similar to the game Reversi.

The first question is a puzzle that is shown on the video screen; the first player to buzz in with the correct answer is awarded the center #13 box. After this, the contestants are introduced. From this point on, players are referred to by their designated color (in Japanese, red is "aka," green is "midori," white is "shiro," and blue is "ao").

From that point on, questions may take any of several forms, including general trivia, an audio question, or a video or picture question or puzzle. Players may buzz in at any time after the announcer begins reading the question. Buzzing in with the correct answer allows the player to capture one of the boxes on the game board. In addition, if by capturing a box, a player brackets one or more boxes held by opposing players, whether in the same row, column, or diagonal, the player steals those boxes.

When capturing a box, players must:

- Make a capture that will steal a box from an opponent
- Failing that, make a capture that will set up a steal on another correct answer.
- Failing both of the above, capture a box that touches at least one other box held by any player.

Any time a contestant answers a question incorrectly, other than on the first question or any puzzle, that player is locked out from answering for two questions (originally three). If a question was answered incorrectly, play ends on that question, and a new question is asked; on a puzzle, play continues until someone answers correctly. (Players who are locked out must stand up from their chair and step away from their buzzers.)
